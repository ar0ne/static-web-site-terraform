# About

This project demonstrates usages of `terraform` as a tool for your infrastructure, and `hugo` as a simple and powerful framework for building static websites.

Read and repeat lessons [here](https://ar0ne.github.io/static-web-site-terraform/).

Shortly, with [*terraform*](https://terraform.io) you could create and setup aws s3 bucket and host static website generated by [*hugo*](https://gohugo.io).

Additionally, you could find `github` action to run same site on gh-pages.
